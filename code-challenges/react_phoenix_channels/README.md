# Realtime Todo with React and Phoenix Channels

Since Phoenix Channels do WebSockets underneath which is a Pub/Sub comm system, this is similar to creating an Nodejs API with Socket.io and ExpressJS, however, surprisingly, the code gets much more organized than the nodejs one.

It was quite tricky to make the Phoenix Channels work on React tho, because you need to adapt the javascript to the framework, I miss the correct types for react typescript btw, but [probably there is a correct way to do this properly](https://medium.com/software-fast-radius/wiring-up-phoenix-channels-with-react-hooks-921aac29f0ff)
