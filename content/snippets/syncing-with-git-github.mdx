$ git commit -m "First Commit" # Commit all modifications on stage with a message.
$ git branch -M main # rename the master branch to main.
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/abehidek/some-repo # add a remote repository labeled "origin".
$ git push -u origin main # Pushes the main local branch to the remote repository.
