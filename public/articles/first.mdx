So, after stalling this project so much, I finally decided to create a blog and start to post in it.

First, I will start introducing me, My name is Guilherme Hidek Abe and in the time I'm writing this blog I have 19 years old and currently working as an apprentice.

Also, I'm from Brazil so my english isn't that good so I can misspell a lot.

I created this blog with the intent of record some of the things I'm learning as a developer, people say the best way to learn is to teach, so by writing some of my learnings, I will remember easily in the future and also, serve as a information source to other people.

I started programming in 2018, but it was only in 2020 that I started to take seriously and learn truly. Only because I needed to build an App as a final project in my course.

At that time, because my final deadline was coming, I discovered a lot of tools, before that I only know how to build simple programs in C and Java because my course taught me.

```java
class HelloWorld() {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

_"Simple" hello world in java_

For those who are curious about my final project, I used React Native, Node and MySQL to build an app that helps you learn new things.

And by similarity, here I am writing this post to an blog that will help me.

In that project, I struggle a lot to learn React Native, my course hasn't taught me things like Callbacks, Promises, Async and Await.

Nowadays, I continue to struggle, but with some coincidence in my criativity and ability of problem solving.

Everyday I try to learn something new, I like a lot of things of development area, but so far web development and data science interest me a lot.

I really expect this project to help someone out there, however I'm not a specialist or an authority so my way of solving problems is not necessarily the best way.

So, with all that said, I thank you for reading so far, and I see you in the next post.
