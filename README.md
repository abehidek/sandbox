## About

All in one repository containing concepts, ideas and projects that I would like to try but not necessarily finish, if something here turns to be project in future I create a special repository for it, however until there it's just an idea being tested, that's why I call this repository sandbox.

The sandbox also contains snippets of code, configuration and other things that I create in order to help people.

In the end it's just for fun.

## Next topics

- [ ] Liveview with Svelte
- [ ] Bench Rustler (Elixir + Rust)
- [ ] Graphics programming
