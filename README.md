## ðŸ”§ Main tools and tecnologies used in the project

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for php framework

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for javascript framework

## How do I run it?

You need to install all dependecies from both api and website, I used NPM (Node Package Manager) to install tailwindcss and other dependencies related to web application, and for API, I used Composer.

- First you need to install MySQL and PHP, I recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to install then, Be sure to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) as well
- Install both [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Clone this repository

### For API
- Use your system console to navigate to [api](https://github.com/abehidek/construp-exam/tree/main/api) folder
- Start MySQL and create new database
- Renamed `.env.example` to `.env` and set up all database information
- Install the dependecies using `$ composer install`
- Run the migrations using `$ php artisan migrate`
- To run it use `$ php artisan serve`

### For Front-End

- Use your system console to navigate to [website](https://github.com/abehidek/construp-exam/tree/main/website) folder
- ~~Install the dependecies using `$ npm install`~~
- Install the dependencies using `$ npm ci` (Upgrading package versions will break.)
- To run it use `$ npm run serve`
