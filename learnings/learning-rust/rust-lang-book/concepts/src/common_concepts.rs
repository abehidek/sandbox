    // # control flow
    // use if else statements to run code depending on a boolean exp
    // if we use other types (like integers) as a control flow exp, we get mismatch error meaning that only boolean exp can be used in control flow
    // this happens because rust does not tries to convert non-bool types into a bool
    // examples of boolean exp are `false`, `true`, `5>3` etc

    // else if is used for multiple conditions whereas else is the final flow clausule
    // one thing worth noticing is that on runtime exec, when it reaches an if-else-if-else statements, it checks one-by-one from top to bottom, but once the program reaches a true condition, it will not check other if-else-if-else statements linked.
    // however using too many else if exp can clutter the code, that's where we use the match exp

    // we can use if in a let statement, since if is an expression that return some value (nothing is a value too)
    let some_condition = true;
    let control_flow_number = if some_condition { 4 } else { 7 }; // the control_flow_number var is bound to a value based on the outcome of the if expression

    // in order for this to work, of course the return variable from all branches need to be the same type, the following code get a error.
    // let number_or_string = if some_condition { 5 } else { "six" }; // `if` and `else` have incompatible types expected integer, found `&str`

    // the above work in many dynamic typed langs such as JS, Python et cetera..., but for safety reasons, each variable in Rust only contains a single type (since it needs to know at compile time what the type of number_or_string is).

    // # repetition with Loops -> three kinds of loops: loop, while and for

    } // similarly to break, we can tell the program to skip any remaining code and start a new iteration of loop, using the continue kw

    // one of the uses of loop, is to retry an operation you know it might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed their job, you might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the break exp you use to stop the loop, that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it.
