# itweek-2018-website
 A website that I created in 2018 when I was learning web development and stuff, for the IT week of my school.

I didn't know so much about web development but I tried really hard on making a different and good looking website, I'm really proud of myself sinceIi remember it was a little bit hard to learn javascript when almost everyone wasn't using at all.

I tried using jquery but there at that time I didn't know so much about, so the code must be pretty bad.

As you can see, almost all the content are in portuguese since I'm from Brazil and in that time I wasn't really worried about it but I plan to remove the images (bc they probably are licensed) and translate to english. 

Also, feel free to copy the code or fork it and pull a request :)

## How do I run it?

it's really simple, you only need to download the repository and run index.html and you are ready to run it.
